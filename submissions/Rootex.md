# Chatting_Web
This is project for SDSLabs Maker. Basically it is chatting web, where more than two person can communicate with each other having common room. In this Project,
I used socket.io, nodejs and express. And also I used Vanilla JS for my frontend part.
# How to run
Firstly, we have to insure that all dependencies and dev dependencies are already installed(like json package, nodeman,express,socket.io and moment).
Then we have to give command to run the server in terminal, as shown below.
